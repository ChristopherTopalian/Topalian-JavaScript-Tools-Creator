# Topalian-JavaScript-Tools-Creator
Creates Rows of useful JavaScript Tools and enables easy design of new JS Tools, which are then placed on any Row chosen, in any order we decide.     Categories of JS Tools can be created using the Sorting System, or the person may alternatively choose to create a new array of data, which contains a new set of Tools.

We can easily sort the Tools by number, date, category, tag, type, or other.
